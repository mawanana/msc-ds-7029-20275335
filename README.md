## Project Description

This project aims to create an integrated system for data scraping, visualization, and API access. It utilizes Apache Airflow for scheduled data scraping tasks, Dash Plotly to create interactive dashboards, and Flask for building API endpoints that connect all the project components.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
MSc DS-7029-20275335/
|-- airflow/
|   |-- dags/
|   |-- config/
|   |-- logs/
|-- dashboard/
|-- api/
|-- data/
|-- requirements.txt
|-- README.md
```

- `airflow/`: Contains Apache Airflow configuration and DAGs for data scraping.
- `dashboard/`: Holds the Dash Plotly dashboard application.
- `api/`: Contains the Flask API for connecting different components.
- `data/`: Stores data files or databases.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists project dependencies.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.7+ installed.
- Virtual environment set up (recommended).

### Installation

1. Clone the project repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MSc DS-7029-20275335.git
   cd MSc DS-7029-20275335
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```shell
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install project dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Scraping with Apache Airflow**: Configure your data scraping tasks in the `airflow/dags/` directory and set up Airflow to schedule and run these tasks.

2. **Dash Plotly Dashboard**: Customize the Dash Plotly dashboard in the `dashboard/` directory. You can modify `app.py` and add components and layouts in the `templates/` directory.

3. **Flask API**: Define your API endpoints in the `api/routes/` directory. Modify `api/app.py` to create API routes that connect your components.

4. **Data Storage**: Store data files or databases in the `data/` directory as needed.

5. Run the components you need according to your project requirements.
